# flask-audio-player

An audio player made with the Flask framework. You can add songs to your audio collection by specifying YouTube video links. I used the Pafy library.

At the time of this message (3/14/2019), the Pafy framework has changed so this audio player does not work.

### Usage:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Change the directory to the folder.
3. Run 'python app.py' in the command line.
